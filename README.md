# Car Garage

## Installation instructions

1. Clone the project to your `~/wcci/code` directory.
1. Once project is successfully cloned, build the project using `gradle eclipse`.
1. Import project into Eclipse and get started.

## Instructions

1. Open test files and write production code to make tests pass.
1. Make a console application with an instance of a `Garage` for your user to interact with.

### Things to keep in mind

1. **ALL** I/O (input and output) should come through the `Application` class.
1. **ALL** logic for the application should be located in the appropriate class (`Garage` or `Car`).
1. `Car`s should be identified uniquely (assume 'users' will provide unique identifiers of some sort).
1. Users should **ONLY** be interacting with individual `Car`s through the `Garage`.
